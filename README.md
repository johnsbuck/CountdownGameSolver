# Countdown Game Solver
This project is meant to solve the following game rounds from the game show Countdown:

1. The Letters Round & Conundrum
2. The Numbers Round

## Rules
### The Letters Round

### Conundrum

### The Numbers Round
There are 24 shuffled face-down numbers organized into two groups:

1. The Small Numbers, consisting of the numbers 1 to 10 twice for a total of 20 numbers.
2. The Large Numbers, consisting of the numbers 25, 50, 75, 100 for a total of 4 numbers.

A contestant chooses 6 numbers from the two groups and a computer generates a random 3-digit number.
The contestants must then figure out how to use the 6 numbers with arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to 
create the randomly-generated 3-digit number.

The contestants do not need to use all 6 numbers to create the 3-digit number.

**Example**

The selected numbers are:

75 50 2 3 8 7

The randomly generated target is:

812

The answer is:

((7 * 2) * (50 + 8)) = 812
